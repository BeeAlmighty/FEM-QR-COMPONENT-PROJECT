### Links

## My process
  - I paid close attention to the style-guide.md to get my project as close to the design as possible.
  
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt 
- how useful and delicate the css flexbox is, how it all boils down to proper nesting and structure.
- how to apply responsive web design with media queries to fit different user screen and how to use a mobile-first design in mind.

### Continued development
I want to delve deeper into css flexbox and fully understand semantic layout and structure to improve its efficiency.
I also want more practice with responsive web design to fully master it.

### Useful resources

- [W3 SCHOOLS](https://w3schools.com) - This helped me with understanding the syntax for responsive web design with media queries.
